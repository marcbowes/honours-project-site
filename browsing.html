						<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p>
							Browsing through a digital collection is a primary function of Digital Repository Systems and entails users being able to navigate through items in the digital collection based on the various categories.
							<p/>
							This is simple to do using database management software (DBMS), but as AJAX is not able to interface with a DBMS and the definition of the project is to minimize the software footprint, the browsing system needs to be implemented from scratch.						
						</p>
						<h4>Design</h4>

						<p>
							Browsing in a Digital Repository System at the lowest level is basically creating lists of items sorted by various criteria which the users can then navigate through. Thus creating a browsing system consists of two parts:
							<ul>
								<li>Sorting the data</li>
								<li>Displaying the sorted lists</li>
							</ul>
							
							As AJAX is unable to write to a filestore, the sorting had to be done in a pre-processor. This essentially sub-divides the browsing system into two separate systems:
							<ul>
								<li>Pre-processor</li>
								<li>Web Site</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							</div>
							<div id="images" class="column-right">
								<img src="resources/images/browse.png"/>
								<p><center>The interaction overview of the system.</center></p>
							</div>
						
						
						<h4>Implementation</h4>
						<p>	
							<h5>Pre-processor</h5>
							<p>
								As stated before, the pre-processor was needed because JavaScript is unable to write to disk.</br>
								The Pre-processors job is to to pre-sort the data by its various metadata fields, as well as performing other tasks described below, in order to allow JavaScript to offer functionality without having to access 	every metadata file.<p/>
								The pre-processor was written in Java, to keep cross platform compatibility.<br/>
								The tasks performed by the pre-processor are:

								<p>
									<b>Sorting the data</b>
								<ul>
									<li>Reading metadata for each valid file from an unknown directory structure.</li>
									<li>Sorting the data based on each of the fields in the metadata.</li>
									<li>Creating a representation for each file.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>


								<p>
								<b>Writing out the lists for the site</b>
								<ul>
								<li>Omitting fields the user does not want to browse.</li>
								<li>Creating pagination.</li>
								<li>Creating quick navigation links.</li>
								<li>Linking the lists to the website.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Once these tasks have been completed the website can use the lists and other files output by the pre-processor to browse the collection.</p>
							</p>
							
							<h5>Web Site</h5>
							<p>
								The Web site handles all the user interaction, facilitating the browsing experience. The Browsing functionality is created dynamically through AJAX.</br>
								The AJAX reads in the lists generated by the Pre-processor and displays them on the page.<br/>
								The users can then navigate through these lists and access items in the lists.								
							</p>
							<p>
								The Web site also provides online integration with the central repository.<br/>
								It does this by requesting an update from the central repository and then integrating the files received with the offline files in real time. 
							</p>
							
						</p>
						
						<h4>Results</h4>
							<p>Various tests were performed, namely:
								<ul>
									<li>Compatibility Testing</li>
									<li>Performance Testing</li>
									<li>User Testing</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								From these tests, the following conclusions were made:
								<ul>
								<li>The system was found to be functional on a range of Operating Systems and Web Browsers.</li>
								<li>Performance was not a hindrance to the browsing experience.</li>
								<li>Even inexperienced users found the system responsive and easy to use. They also believed that the system had all the necessary functionality for a simple browsing system.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
						
						<h4>Conclusion</h4>
						<p>Based on the goal of creating a lightweight and distributable digital repository system, an experimental browsing system was designed and implemented that can be used offline and online with no extra software needed other than a JavaScript compliant Web Browser.</p>
						<p>Testing this system showed that it succeeded in being distributable, lightweight and providing the basic functionality expected of a browsing system. However, the AJAX limitations were present, in that it required a pre-processor in order to provide the browsing functionality. The nature of AJAX also limited the functionality that could be implemented.</p>
